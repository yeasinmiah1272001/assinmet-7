# Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.
In my assignment project, I managed state primarily through React's useState and useEffect hooks. I maintained various state variables to track application data and user interactions. These included data fetched from APIs, user inputs, and UI-related states like visibility toggles. I used useState to initialize and update these variables based on user actions and asynchronous data fetching. Additionally, I employed the useEffect hook to fetch and update data when the component mounted or when specific dependencies changed. This allowed for dynamic rendering of components and responsive user experiences. Overall, I leveraged React's built-in state management capabilities to efficiently handle data and UI changes in my project.
